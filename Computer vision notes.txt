Image processing app using python – project topic

Input output load image

In – picture – one page instructions and packages and requirements, → manual

Project is 40% 

seminar is 10% - any  topic related to computer vision – 20 mins presentation

fpga is like rows and coloumns [ need to learn more]

noise comes from heat from the circuitrar

→ Camera response function f(): Image brightness depends onelectron flux and photon flux. See the formula in slide number 85. 

>- non linear curve in camera response curve because of saturation or brightness is 

> slide 89: exposure bracketing is summing up all (used in iphone 4 initially)

> a graysclae is a 2d function - we can filter it (changing pixel value without changeing pixel positions) and warping (shifting of pixels but the color info remains same)

high frequency contains edges data while low frequency contains a blurry image with soft colors
Fourier transform is used to filter them out. 
 
>  warping applications - (pending in slide)
> transofmations: 
scaling (each component is multiplied by a scalar ) (unifrom scaling - same scalar for each component)
matrixes are awesome when it comes to computations x'= ax and y' = b.y
Shearing: x' = x+ a.y and y' = b.x + y 

rotation: using polar cordinates

Identity matrix clones - question pending

translation: x' = x + t and y' = y + t (matrix representation is not possible)

> Homogenours cordinates: heterogeneous cordinates can be made homo by converting 2d to 3d vector. last 3d vector is the scaling factor. 
Why are they helpful? because we can do matrix representation of translation using homogenous vectors. 
1 doesnt matter as you get the same value back , if ti was other value thhen it would be a scaling factor.

a combined matrix of rotation and translation where first four elements of matrix is responsible for rotation and last coloumn vecctor is responsible of translation. 

matrix multiplication order maters as matrix multiplication is non-commutative.

> classificatio of 2d transformation
similarity: uniform scaling + rotation + translation
affine transform: unifrom scaling + shearing + rotation + translation 

note: for 3x3, degree of freedoms 8 is maximum.
Homework: degree of freedoms in different transformations
